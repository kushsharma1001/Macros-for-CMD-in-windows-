1) Create a file to store your commands and its alias, (say macros.doskey) "C:\user\macros.doskey".
This file should contain your commands and its alias exactly like mentioned below :
ls=dir $* $T
up=cd.. $T
ex=exit $T
np=notepad

2) Now, Go to start menu. Go to the registry editor. 
   Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\
   Right-click and add a new "String Value" sub-key. Name it Autorun. 
   Right-click -> New -> String Value

   Right-click it and Modify the Value data. 
   Right-click -> Modify -> Value data -> DOSKEY /MACROFILE="C:\user\macros.doskey"

Good to go.

† Note that the file does not have to be saved as a .doskey file. 
† Also note that the token $T is required if you're making multiple DOSKEYs.
